This course provides students with a basic understanding of the fundamental principles of 3D modeling, from basic object modeling through texturing, lighting, and scene rendering. By the end of this course, you will be equipped with the knowledge and skills to create, texture, light, and render your own 3D scenes.

## Program Content

Our journey into 3D modeling will primarily utilize **Blender** and the course has a duration of 10 hours.

### Module 1: Fundamental Concepts of 3D Modeling

*   **What is 3D modeling?**
*   **A brief history of 3D**
*   **What are 3D modeling software?**

In this module, learners will understand the history of 3D modeling, why it is important, learn about the different tools available for 3D modeling today, and its applications.

### Module 2: First Steps: Getting Familiar with the Tool

*   **Overview of the interface**
*   **Navigating the 3D space (movement, rotation, and camera zoom)**
*   **Basic object manipulation**

**Class Exercise:** Create a table
**Challenge:** Model a chair

In this module, learners will begin to acclimate to the software interface and its various tools, becoming capable of modeling simple objects by combining basic shapes.

### Module 3: Introduction to Modeling

*   **Fundamentals of how a mesh works**
*   **Distinguishing Object and Edit modes**
*   **Introduction to Extrude, Loop Cuts, Subdivide, and Bevel**
*   **Introduction to modifiers (Mirror, Screw, Subdivision Surface, and Shade Smooth)**

**Class Exercise:** Model a bottle and a teapot
**Challenge:** Model a customized cup

This module introduces the use of modifiers, enabling learners to create more complex objects with shapes that would be impossible using only the previous techniques.

### Module 4: Materials and Textures

*   **Introduction to the Shader Editor**
*   **Introduction to the Node System**
*   **Introduction to UV Maps**

**Class Exercise:** Add a label and a simple texture to the bottle
**Challenge:** Add textures to the other previously created objects

This module marks the post-modeling phase, focusing on textures and materials. Learners will be able to create, import, and apply materials to the objects made in previous lessons.

### Module 5: Lighting and Cameras

*   **Introduction to lights**
*   **Types of lights and intensity**
*   **Introduction to cameras**
*   **Camera properties**
*   **Principles of composition and visual presentation**

**Class Exercise:** Light the bottle in three different ways
**Challenge:** Combine all previously created objects into a scene, light it, and create a composition with depth of field

In this module, learners will understand how to add lights to a scene and the importance of lighting in final renders. They will also learn to manipulate cameras and how their properties affect scenes.

### Module 6: Rendering

*   **How to render a scene**
*   **Rendering engines â€“ EEVEE**
*   **Rendering settings**
*   **Exporting images**

**Class Exercise:** Render the scene created with the objects from the previous exercise

This final module enables learners to understand the rendering process and adjust its settings. At this stage, the learner is equipped with all aspects of 3D modeling, including modeling simple objects, applying textures, lighting, and rendering a scene using the EEVEE engine.

## What I learn

Upon completing this course, I'm able to:

*   Understand the core concepts and history of 3D modeling.
*   Navigate and utilize the Blender interface effectively.
*   Model basic and complex objects using various techniques and modifiers.
*   Apply materials and textures to your 3D models using the Shader Editor and Node System.
*   Set up and manipulate lights and cameras for compelling scene compositions.
*   Render high-quality images of your 3D scenes using the EEVEE engine.
