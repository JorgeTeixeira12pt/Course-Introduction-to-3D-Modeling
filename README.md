# Course Introduction to 3D Modeling
This course aims to provide students with a basic understanding of the fundamental principles of 3D modeling, from basic object modeling through texturing, lighting, and scene rendering. Introduction to 3D Modeling.

PROGRAM CONTENT
Tool Used: Blender

1. Fundamental Concepts of 3D Modeling
a. What is 3D modeling?

b. A brief history of 3D

c. What are 3D modeling software?

In this module, learners should understand the history of 3D modeling, why it is important, learn about the different tools available for 3D modeling today, and its applications.

2. First Steps: Getting Familiar with the Tool
a. Overview of the interface

b. Navigating the 3D space (movement, rotation, and camera zoom)

c. Basic object manipulation

Class Exercise: Create a table
Challenge: Model a chair

In this module, learners begin to acclimate to the software interface and its various tools, becoming capable of modeling simple objects by combining basic shapes.

3. Introduction to Modeling
a. Fundamentals of how a mesh works

b. Distinguishing Object and Edit modes

c. Introduction to Extrude, Loop Cuts, Subdivide, and Bevel

d. Introduction to modifiers (Mirror, Screw, Subdivision Surface, and Shade Smooth)

Class Exercise: Model a bottle and a teapot
Challenge: Model a customized cup

This module introduces the use of modifiers, enabling learners to create more complex objects with shapes that would be impossible using only the previous techniques.

4. Materials and Textures
a. Introduction to the Shader Editor

b. Introduction to the Node System

c. Introduction to UV Maps

Class Exercise: Add a label and a simple texture to the bottle
Challenge: Add textures to the other previously created objects

This module marks the post-modeling phase, focusing on textures and materials. Learners will be able to create, import, and apply materials to the objects made in previous lessons.

5. Lighting and Cameras
a. Introduction to lights

b. Types of lights and intensity

c. Introduction to cameras

d. Camera properties

e. Principles of composition and visual presentation

Class Exercise: Light the bottle in three different ways
Challenge: Combine all previously created objects into a scene, light it, and create a composition with depth of field

In this module, learners will understand how to add lights to a scene and the importance of lighting in final renders. They will also learn to manipulate cameras and how their properties affect scenes.

6. Rendering
a. How to render a scene

b. Rendering engines â€“ EEVEE

c. Rendering settings

d. Exporting images

Class Exercise: Render the scene created with the objects from the previous exercise

This final module enables learners to understand the rendering process and adjust its settings. At this stage, the learner is equipped with all aspects of 3D modeling, including modeling simple objects, applying textures, lighting, and rendering a scene using the EEVEE engine.
